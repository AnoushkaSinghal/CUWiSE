        <p>Olivia Turner is in the early stages of her career, having graduated this year from Carleton, but she’s been making huge strides in the STEM field for a while. In March of 2019, she and a few other students started the Stigma Ends at CU campaign (@stigmaendsatcu on all social media platforms) under Professor Kim Hellemans and in partnership with CSSA (Canadian Center on Substance Use and Addiction). This ongoing campaign focuses on normalizing the conversation around substance use and addiction thus aiming to reduce the stigma around it.
        <br><br>

        Currently, she’s working at CCSA and is pursuing research on substance use disorders. She is interested in looking at risk factors for addiction, and how scientists can use that knowledge to inform prevention/intervention treatments for individuals with substance use disorders. She will also be researching impulsivity as it relates to addiction, and how this trait can be amplified among those with a a behavioural addiction or substance use disorder. In the future, she hopes that addiction is treated like any other disorder or illness so that people can receive support and treatment

        <br><br>
        Science is something that she always knew she would go into, but she credits her pursuit of neuroscience to her first neuroscience class, where she realized that it is where she is supposed to be and was able to analyze life through a neuroscience lens. Turner realized that she wanted to help improve lives through neuroscience and is grateful for the support she has received during her undergrad, particularly from her mentor, Dr. Hellemans.

        <br><br>

        Aside from her work in science, she enjoys running outside, spending time in nature (fun fact; she’s from the East Coast!) and podcasts, (“Unlocking Us” by Brené Brownis her recommendation).

        <br><br>
        As a recent graduate, she is about to start her Masters in Neuroscience at McMasterUniversity under Dr. Iris Balodis. A tip she wants to share to everyone reading is thatyou should “get involved in the field in a number of ways and try things out. It is theperfect time to explore different areas and see what you’re passionate about and where your interests lie. Try volunteering in many different areas and take advantage of the opportunities presented to you. The only way you can grow is by stepping out of your comfort zone and exploring your options.”.

        <p>Dr. Leila Mostaço-Guidolin is an Assistant Professor for the Department
          of Systems and Computer Engineering at Carleton. Her research endeavours
          include combining optical microscopy, biophotonics and 3D bioprinting to
          build artificial tissue that canmimic extracellular environments.
          <br><br>

          Following a bachelor’s degree in Medical Physics, a Masters in Physics
          Applied to Medicine and Biology and a PhD in Biomedical Engineering,
          she describes teaching and research as a natural choice, “I enjoy interacting
          with young people, aiming to create an environment where the next
          generation can grow, learn to think critically, and be motivated."
          She is looking forward to creating this kind of environment at Carleton!

          Dr. Guidolin’s ProfileDr. Leila Mostaço-Guidolin is an Assistant Professor for the Department of Systems and Computer Engineering at Carleton. Her research endeavours include combining optical microscopy, biophotonics and 3D bioprinting to build artificial tissue that canmimic extracellular environments.Following a bachelor’s degree in Medical Physics, a Masters in Physics Applied to Medicine and Biology and a PhD in Biomedical Engineering, she describes teaching and research as a natural choice, “I enjoy interacting with young people, aiming to create an environment where the next generation can grow, learn to think critically, and be motivated." She is looking forward to creating this kind of environment at Carleton!Dr. Guidolin attributes her initial interest in STEM to her eagerness as a child to readthe entire encyclopedia set!While fortunate enoughto not face many obstacles as awoman in STEM, she attests to the importance of diversity and representation of women, LGBTQ people, and people of color, in all disciplines, and at all organizational levels in order to minimize these obstacles. “We only win by having people of different backgrounds at the table. Every group brings their unique experience and perspectives....This diversity is exactly what we need to approach and solve challenges differently and creatively.”
          <br><br>

          Whenasked about how we can encourage women to pursue careers in STEM, Dr. Guidolin argues that, "The key is to encourage and advertise to women the kind of careers and opportunities available to them, to show them that they are just as capable as anybody to pursue careers in these STEM. We should also focus on deconstructing the gender stereotypes that restrict women so early on in their journey. Who says women can’t be smart, strong, and pretty if they wish so?” Finally, she says, "groups, like WISE, are needed to continue to empower women and show them that they have support, even in male-dominated fields."

          <br><br>

          Dr. Guidolin’s advice to women in all disciplines: "Don't be intimidated and don’t be afraid of change - your path is not set in stone. Follow your true passion."

        <p>We couldn't be more excited to introduce to you our first Faculty Leading
          Lady, Prof Lynn Marshall. She needs no introduction around Carleton for
          all she does. She is one of a kind! As a seasonal lecturer for the Facluty
          of Engineering and Design, Prof Marshall takes on over a thousand, and I
          literally mean well over a thousand students A SEMESTER!! When she is not
          organizing dozens of TAs and her thousand plus students, she dabbles in
          Formal Methods for Software Engineering (i.e., she uses a particular kind
          of mathematically based techniques to improve the reliability and robustness
          for the specification, development, and verification of software systems).
          Impressive eh! If you ever venture to the other side of the tracks, you may
          see and/or hear her on the pool deck as your Ravens Varsity Swim Coach! Like
          a true leader, she also competes as a Master Swimmer, and she is darn good at
          it too! In grade 12, Prof Marshall won the Manitoba Grade 12 Math Contest. When
          the paper printed her victory, the headline read "Girl Wins Math Contest". This
          was a turning point for Prof Marshall and her academic career. We would like to
          think she proved that paper wrong for all that she has accomplished in her life
          time! So, thank you Manitoba for inspiring one of our favourites! </p>

        <p>She just may be the definition of WISE! Dr Winnie Ye was awarded the
          IEEE Women in Engineering (WIE) Inspiring Member of the Year Award this
          past June! #yourock Not only does she make Carleton better as a faculty
          member for FED, she is also a WISE Alumni! #tooawesome Currently sitting
          as the Canada Research Chair (Tier II), and an Associate Professor for the
          Faulty of Engineering and Design, Dr Ye truly inspires us! When not inspiring
          WISE or WiE around campus, Dr Ye leads the IEEE WiE Ottawa Chapter as their
          Chair. She has surrounded herself with amazing #womeniSTEM, and is most
          definitely leaving a legacy. In her spare time, she does some pretty amazing
          work within electrical engineering and silicon photonics. If you haven't
          seen her work, we highly encourage you make the effort to see her speak next!
          She has come along way since her first conference presentation in California,
          where she knew this was the path for her! We are so lucky to call her a mentor
          & even happier she is here at CU with us! </p>
